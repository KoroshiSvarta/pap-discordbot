# pap-assistance-discord-bot
A discord bot that assists in the daily struggles of dungeons masters and players around the world

Still figuring out how git works, so bear with me.

Command:
!nick register "Your Nick" "Channel Name" - Registeres your nickname
!nick delete "Your Nick" - Deletes your nick

This is just a pure implemenation of the nick feature of the Discord bot. If anyone is interested in having a dice rolling feature, I'd also add that to this bot. (Example: https://imgur.com/a/OtFvcJY)

To make this bot work, one needs to install node.js, initialize the directory by opening a command prompt.
Enter "npm init" and "npm install discord.js". I believe that should be all, but tell me if it's not.

To make the bot work, rename the config_example.json to config.json and edit the file to contain everything nessecary. (Meaning server id, aswell as bot token)

This bot is currently intended to be used by people who have a basic understanding of how to setup a discord bot and handle node.js.
